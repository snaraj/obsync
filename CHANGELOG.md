## 0.1.0 - Unreleased

### Added

- Repository contract, architecture, wire protocol, storage, threat model,
  benchmark, validation, and platform-onboarding documents.
- Start-time volume posture: `serve`, `check`, and `export` measure the type,
  owner, and mode of both volume roots and both credential files before
  anything is read or written through them. A weak mode is corrected and
  re-read; a link, a substituted type, or a foreign owner refuses the start.
- A ceiling on the heads one file may hold, equal to the parents one version
  may declare, so a conflicted file is always resolvable by one merge naming
  every head and the head list a response carries is bounded. The version
  that would pass it is refused with `409 too_many_heads` and nothing
  already stored changes; replay applies what the journal already holds.
- Replay protection that survives a restart: every accepted nonce is
  appended to `v1/nonces` on the journal volume and fsynced before its
  request is answered, and a start loads back what the 600 s window still
  covers. The file is rewritten once it passes twice the cache's ceiling, a
  torn final line costs only itself, and a volume that will not take the
  record refuses the request with `503 nonce_log_unavailable`.
